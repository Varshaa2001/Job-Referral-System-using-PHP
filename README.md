The task is Adding reference points
## Condition:
If Person B is joined by the reference of Person A, then 10 points should be added to A. Where Person A is referred to as a 1st referral. If Person C is joined by the reference of Person B, then 20 points are added to Person A, and
10 points are added to Person B, where Person B is referred to as a 2nd referral. If person C is left or dismissed, then 7 points will be reduced to the 2nd referral and 8 points
will be reduced to the 1st referral. If the person C joins again then points should be added to both the referral as before ( ie 20

## WORK ACCOMPLISHED:
The web page is done with HTML and PHP. The HTML code creates a simple web page for a "Referral System". The UI provides
a form for users to interact with a referral system, allowing them to add or dismiss a person
with the option to enter the referrer's name when adding a person. The persons who are
available for referral and dismissal, will be listed in a dropdowN.
